## Step 4: Log in

Keys pressed: ```<ctrl+v> <enter>``` 

I copied the ```ssh``` command from a Lab Report 1, and pasted it into the terminal.

## Step 5: Clone Repository
Keys pressed: ```<up><up><up><up><up><enter>```

I had the ```git clone``` command saved in my bash history from a attempt, and I navigated to it using the up arrow.

## Step 6: Run tests, confirm they fail
Keys pressed: 

```cd lab7 <enter>```

I ```cd```'d into the newly cloned directory so that my saved JUnit commands, which did not use ```lab7/``` as part of the path, would run in the correct directory.

```ls <enter> ```

I used ```ls``` to ensure I was in the correct directory. This step is not necessary and could have been skipped to save a few miliseconds.

```<up><up><up><up><up><up><up><enter>```
```<up><up><up><up><up><up><up><enter>```

Both the ```javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java``` (compile) and ```java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests``` (run JUnit tests) commands were saved in my bash history from a previous run, so I used the up arrow to access them.
